# Next.js Phase 1: Fundamentals

Welcome to Next.js Phase 1. This phase focuses on the core framework features and how they differ from React.

## How to Use This Folder

You only need these 4 files:

1. 00_START_HERE.md (this file)
2. PHASE_1_GUIDE.md (requirements only, no code)
3. CODE_REFERENCE.md (syntax and patterns)
4. PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (scores and checklists)

## Rules (Same as before)

- No code in the guide file.
- Use CODE_REFERENCE.md for syntax only.
- Build the project yourself from requirements.
- Submit for review and I will score and update the tracker.

## Review and Scoring

- I will review using the 100-point rubric:
	- Functionality 30
	- Code Quality 20
	- Next.js Best Practices 20
	- Styling/UX 15
	- Performance 10
	- Documentation 5
- Progress is tracked in PROGRESS_TRACKER.md with dates and marks obtained.

## Phase 1 Projects

Mini Projects:
- 1.1: Routing Basics
- 1.2: Data Fetching (SSR/SSG)
- 1.3: API Routes
- 1.4: Image and Metadata

Capstone:
- Next.js Starter Portfolio

## Task Flow (How We Work)

1. You pick the next mini project or capstone in PHASE_1_GUIDE.md.
2. Build it from the requirements only (no code snippets in the guide).
3. Submit your work for review.
4. I score it, give feedback, and update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md.

## What You Will Master

- File-based routing
- Layouts and nested routes
- SSR vs SSG vs CSR
- API routes and handlers
- Image optimization
- Metadata and SEO basics
- Deployment mindset

When you are ready, open PHASE_1_GUIDE.md.
